My name is Alisina Bahadori, I'm a computer geek.

### More Information

I'm a DevOps Engineer and I love backend developement. I mainly focus on Elixir/OTP because my
passion has always been designing fault tollerant, scalable distributed systems, and OTP is just
made for that.

Other than that, I love experimenting with new software and technologies. Guess you may call me
a technophile :)
