NanoPi NEO Housing
So in the last post [``Nanopi Neo as Webserver``](https://alisinabh.com/post/1489244977234/NanoPi_Neo_as_Webserver) i came up to idea of serving alisinabh.com on a NanoPi Neo small arm based computer.

The latest things that i struggled with was:
 - Housing
 - Heatsync
 - Static IP

About the heatsync, I found an old asus mainboard which had a tiny heatsync near it's south bridge. It fit perfectly. Even i used some thermal paste on back of board for better heat flow.

But about the housing... Things got out of hand. Seriously out of hand!

First i wanted to outsource printing of the normal NanoPi Neo housing (Since i cannot buy it from my location) But...

I really wanted a 3D printer for long time! Maybe buy one?

No shit! They're really expensive and out of my budget.

So after some researching around 3D printers i ended up reading ["Super Cheap 3D Printer From CD-Rom Drives"](http://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Cheap-3D-Printer-From-CD-Rom-Drives/). Of course it is not going to be in any good shape or quality bit it can bdo the job i think.

So this is the reason for the delay of serving my blog on a NanoPi NEO board.

Thank you for reading this.
